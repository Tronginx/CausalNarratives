TSMC: A Strong Buy At All-Time Highs
Summary
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited delivered strong Q3 results, beating expectations with robust revenue growth and expanding gross margins.
TSMC dominates the foundry market with over 70% share, benefiting from surging AI chip demand. The company is seeing strong revenue and earnings momentum. Gross margins are rising.
The foundry raised its 2025 revenue and CapEx guidance amid a booming AI chip market.
TSMC trades at a significant discount to peers like NVDA and AMD, offering an attractive value-to-risk profile and 23% upside potential.
Despite cyclicality risks, TSMC's market leadership and profitability support a continued strong buy rating, even near all-time highs.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited aka TSMC (NYSE:TSM) submitted a strong earnings sheet for the third fiscal quarter on Thursday, highlighting strong profitability amid consistent spending momentum in the Data Center industry as well as an ability to expand its gross margins. The foundry beat expectations on the bottom and the top lines and the financial figures painted a very rosy picture for this chip play.

TSMC continues to dominate the foundry market and reported double-digit earnings growth in the September quarter. Despite sizzling business performance, shares of the foundry are still very attractively valued and much cheaper compared to Nvidia (NVDA), as an example. I see a favorable risk profile amid a massive market share in the foundry industry and a raised guidance for FY 2025 revenue, and I continue to recommend TSMC as a Strong Buy, despite shares of the foundry trading at all-time highs.

Previous rating
Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing were a Strong Buy for me previously -- The Only AI Fab Game In Town -- because of the firm's dominant position in the foundry market. In the third-quarter, TSMC benefited from a strong order situation for AI chips and the company was able to translate demand for its products into serious growth for revenue and earnings. I like that TSMC continues to expand its gross margins, highlighting pricing strength, and I see continual upside revaluation momentum if current CapEx trends last.

TSMC beat Q3 ’25 estimates
The world’s biggest foundry reported better-than-expected results for its September quarter amid a major AI chip spending splurge: TSMC had GAAP earnings of $2.92 per-share, beating the consensus estimate by $0.32 per-share. The top line came in at $33.1B and was $1.5B better than the average prediction.

TSMC is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world occupying a crucial part in the semiconductor value chain: TSMC manufacturers, on behalf of the world’s largest chip-design companies, high-performing AI chips in its foundries. These chips are used in everything from electric vehicles to robots and Data Centers, and are the hottest commodity in the hyperscaler market right now.

In the third fiscal quarter, TSMC generated $33.1B in net revenue, showing a massive 41% year-over-year growth rate… and beating the firm’s own guidance of $31.8-33.0B in revenue. TSMC’s revenue growth has soared in recent quarters, especially in the last two years, as a booming market for AI chips caused serious tailwinds for the company’s core chip manufacturing business.

Importantly, TSMC managed to translate this sizzling demand for AI chips into real margin and earnings growth. In Q3 ’25, TSMC had a gross margin of 59.5%, showing a 0.9 PP margin gain compared to the previous quarter and exceeding the top-end of its third-quarter guidance by 2 PP. In terms of earnings, TSMC’s income grew a massive 39.0% year-over-year, highlighting that the company is able to grow very profitably.


The ability to grow both quickly and improve its profitability profile is directly related to TSMC controlling most of the foundry market.

TSMC is the most significant foundry player in the industry that is manufacturing AI chips on behalf of companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Apple (AAPL). In the second quarter, the last quarter for which market share data is available, TSMC allegedly had a market share of ~71%, according to Counterpoint Research, leading Samsung and other foundries by a lot. TSMC earlier this year increased its investment program and is now targeting $165B in investments in the U.S. in order to build domestic chip manufacturing capacities.


As the world's largest foundry, TSMC is well positioned to benefit from increases in capital spending in the Data Center industry. Nvidia is projecting that CapEx spending in this market is set to grow to $3-4 trillion by the end of the decade which calculates to 40% average annual growth. This growth, which may be driven especially by AI investments in the industrial realm, could be a major boost for TSMC which is already heavily investing in ramping up its AI chip production.

In terms of free cash flow, TSMC remained highly profitable as well in Q3, although the company should be expected to sacrifice short term profitability in order to grow its manufacturing capabilities in the quarters ahead.

In the third quarter, TSMC generated free cash flow of NT$139.4B, showing a decline rate of 25% year-over-year, mainly due to higher CapEx (+39% Y/Y). As a result, the foundry's free cash flow margin contracted by more than 10 PP year-over-year to 14.1% as of the end of the September quarter.

TSMC’s valuation
In addition to strong secular growth momentum across key performance metrics such as revenue, gross margin and earnings, TSMC has one of the most appealing risk profiles, in my opinion.

The semiconductor company is growing its business hand over fist and currently trades at a forward price-to-revenue ratio of 26.1X… making the chip enterprise significantly cheaper than Nvidia or AMD. Technically, Nvidia and AMD are chip-design companies and depend on TSMC for chip manufacturing, but all companies benefit fundamentally from the same underlying growth drivers in the Data Center industry: AI.

Shares of Nvidia and AMD are trading, on a forward FY 2026 basis, at earnings multipliers of 28.3X and 37.3X. AMD especially has become significantly more expensive lately after the company announced a landmark chip deal with OpenAI (OPENAI). Nvidia, the world's largest chip-design company, struck its own $100B investment deal with OpenAI in September that ensures that the Chat.GPT creator will get access to Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin GPU platform (expected for 2026).

I fully expect shares of TSMC to achieve at least a ~30X forward earnings multiplier which at this point implies a fair value of $369. This calculation is based off of a consensus EPS estimate of $12.29/share next year which implies approximately 23% upside revaluation potential.

Raised outlook for CapEx and revenue
Soaring demand for leading-edge chips for AI applications has led TSMC to raised its guidance for key metrics for FY 2025 on Thursday as well: TSMC expects to spend between $40-42B on capital investments this year, showing a $2.0B raise at the low-end of guidance. The firm's revenue guidance for FY 2025 implies 35% year-over-year growth vs. 30% earlier this year.

Risks with TSMC
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is growing rapidly, but risks exist that should not be discounted. TSMC runs an enormously capital-intensive business which limits competition. However, capital spending in the semiconductor industry is notoriously volatile and demand for chips can disappear overnight if companies fear a recession and adjust their CapEx levels in expectations of slowing demand. What would my change my mind about TSMC is if the semiconductor enterprise were to see a sector-wide decline in CapEx spending or started to see a gross margin contraction in its manufacturing business.

Final thoughts
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing submitted a strong earnings sheet for the third fiscal quarter on Thursday that was marked by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and material earnings momentum. TSMC is still by far the world’s largest foundry, with a market share of more than 70% (based off of Counterpoint Q2 '25 market data) which makes the company a potential winner, in my book, as hyperscalers and chip firms race to up-grade their IT infrastructures in the next several years. Shares are moderately valued given the strength of the value proposition and I continue to see a lot of upside revaluation potential for TSMC... even with shares trading at all-time highs.

time_span: short_term
reasoning_content:
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares climbed more than 2% on Monday to $732, extending their rebound as investors welcomed the company’s new artificial intelligence partnership with Arm Holdings (ARM). The collaboration, aimed at developing energy-efficient chip platforms to power Meta’s personalization and recommendation systems, has been received as a sign of long-term commitment to scaling AI capabilities across its ecosystem. The partnership with Arm comes at a crucial time for Meta, which has faced a volatile trading month amid market-wide profit-taking in large-cap tech. Investors view the deal as a strategic step that could strengthen the company’s infrastructure backbone, allowing more efficient AI model deployment across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. The agreement aligns with Meta’s broader AI roadmap, which focuses on delivering personalized experiences while improving computational efficiency. Arm’s expertise in low-power architectures offers potential cost and performance advantages over traditional chip designs. Analysts have interpreted this as a move that could reduce reliance on external chipmakers and accelerate Meta’s internal AI scaling efforts. Fundamentally, the development underscores Meta’s ambition to move beyond short-term advertising cycles and focus on building long-term technological depth. This pivot is increasingly significant as the competition in generative and recommendation-based AI intensifies, with peers like Google and Amazon also ramping up infrastructure spending. Technical setup shows early signs of recovery From a technical standpoint, Meta is showing signs of stabilization after its recent corrective phase. The stock rebounded from the $694–$675 support zone, which coincides with the 100-day exponential moving average and the lower Bollinger Band. Price has now reclaimed the 20-day EMA at $726, while a close above the 50-day EMA at $733 would further confirm a short-term trend reversal. Meta stock price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bollinger Bands have narrowed, signaling reduced volatility compared to September’s swings. A sustained move above the midline could pave the way toward resistance at $758, followed by $780, where prior distribution occurred. The Relative Strength Index has recovered to 52, suggesting that downside momentum has eased and buyers are gradually regaining control. On the downside, $720 remains immediate support, followed by deeper cushions at $694 and $675. Failure to hold these levels could expose the stock to renewed selling pressure, though the technical bias remains constructive while it trades above the lower channel boundary. Outlook As highlighted in prior analysis, Meta’s broader trend remains underpinned by investor confidence in its AI expansion and data center build-out. The Arm partnership reinforces this narrative, adding a new layer to its competitive advantage in custom computing. With earnings season approaching, markets will focus on whether these investments translate into revenue acceleration or cost efficiencies. If the stock sustains momentum above $733, analysts expect a retest of $758 in the near term, with $780 marking a key inflection point for a potential return to the broader uptrend. For now, Meta’s combination of strategic clarity, technical recovery, and renewed investor optimism positions it as one of the more resilient AI-linked names in the market.

This semiconductor and networking specialist is beginning to expand its influence in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. The current wave of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption began in early 2023, after the introduction of ChatGPT highlighted the vast potential applications involving generative AI. Nvidia (NVDA +2.60% ), with its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), quickly became the standard-bearer for the AI revolution. Its stock has gained 1,160% since then, which has investors eager to find the next Nvidia, and a strong contender could be hiding in plain sight. While Nvidia stock has gained a respectable 33% over the past year, Broadcom (AVGO +1.97% ) has been on a tear, as its stock has soared 96% (as of this writing). Several recent developments help illustrate why investors are increasingly bullish on Broadcom stock, and why the company could well be the next Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Same tailwinds, different driver GPUs have played a pivotal role in the advancement of AI, providing the computational horsepower required to power the large language models (LLMs) that underpin AI. One of the trade-offs, however, is that these power-hungry chips consume a great deal of energy. Thus far, most hyperscalers have been willing to pay the price to have the most advanced processors with the fastest speeds, not to mention the extreme flexibility offered by GPUs. Since most AI processing occurs in data centers, Broadcom was already a beneficiary of AI, as management notes that "99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology." The company pioneered the Ethernet switching and networking products that have become critical components in most data centers. However, it's Broadcom's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that offer the greatest potential for future growth, thanks to their increasing adoption for AI workloads. The specialized chips are customizable to specific tasks, offering a more energy-efficient alternative. The demand for these chips is evident in Broadcom's most recent results.

It was clear that AI was the biggest contributor to its rising fortunes, as AI-specific revenue of $5.2 billion surged 63%. Management noted that Broadcom continued to expand its relationships with its three biggest hyperscale customers, widely believed to be Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. CEO Hock Tam said, "We continue to gain share at our three original customers." He also expects growth related to AI to continue to accelerate, outpacing the 50% to 60% the company has forecast for this year.

The deal is likely incremental to Broadcom's already robust guidance, according to Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, who estimates that each gigawatt could translate to $20 billion in additional revenue. Furthermore, the deal serves to validate Broadcom's chips as a viable alternative to Nvidia's GPUs, which might attract additional large-scale users. Reitzes has previously argued that Broadcom should be a "Magnificent Eight" stock, an addition to the existing "Magnificent Seven" stocks. He estimates that Broadcom will gain ground over time, eventually controlling 30% of the AI compute market. The next Nvidia? The expanding relationships with its existing customers, as well as the addition of OpenAI to its customer rolls, illustrate the path forward for Broadcom to become the next Nvidia. Furthermore, the AI market is expected to grow exponentially. Big Four accounting firm PwC estimates the market could be worth as much as $15.7 trillion annually by 2030, which helps underscore the magnitude of the opportunity. There is the matter of valuation to consider. Broadcom stock is currently selling for 38 times next year's earnings, compared to 29 for Nvidia. Both stocks currently fetch a premium, so they won't be a good fit for every investor. That said, both companies are at the crossroads of the AI revolution, which could continue to drive these industry pioneers higher in the months and years to come.

ticker: BABA
company_name: Alibaba
stance: long
time_span: long_term

Summary
Alibaba stands as a tech giant with diversified businesses spanning e-commerce, cloud, AI, logistics, and digital media, driving robust growth.
BABA's aggressive R&D and capex investments, global cloud expansion, and AI partnerships, notably with Nvidia, position it as a future-proof global leader.
The company’s valuation is attractive, with a conservative P/E below 20 and strong EPS growth prospects, despite geopolitical and demographic risks.
I rate BABA as a strong buy, citing its innovation, international growth, and resilience against macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds.
PK24/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images
Reasons To Invest In BABA
The biggest reason to invest in Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)(OTCPK:BABAF) is because it is one of the largest and most successful tech companies in China, the world's second economy. The Chinese economy is expected to dethrone the United States in terms of nominal GDP over the next few decades.

Alibaba's latest earnings
Alibaba's business mix is solid and looks very much like Amazon's (AMZN). Its core business is e-commerce, which is conducted both in China and internationally. However, the fastest growing business is its "Cloud Intelligence Group", which is already quite big and represents 13.5% of consolidated sales. Other businesses include Cainiao Smart Logistics Network, maps, food delivery, digital media, and entertainment. Therefore, the company's business mix is very diversified and spans across various growing industries.

Seeking Alpha
With such an extensive business mix, it is no surprise that BABA maintained almost 30% revenue CAGR over the last decade. Profitability growth was behind revenue growth, but it was not due to the business model but because of the company's aggressive investments in future growth. The company's TTM net capex is $17 billion, and R&D spending is $8.2 billion, which is $25.2 billion in total. Thus, Alibaba reinvests around 18% of revenue in R&D and capex. And when we look at the company's historical revenue growth, we see that aggressive innovation pays back. Moreover, a $23 billion net cash position makes BABA firmly positioned to maintain this pace of innovation.

Statista
All these investments did not only help Alibaba to become China's undisputed number one in e-commerce but also to become one of the world's largest cloud infrastructure service providers. In fact, there are only three cloud behemoths from the U.S. ahead of Alibaba in this market. Therefore, Alibaba is very firmly positioned in this vast and thriving industry. Moreover, it also means that Alibaba is also the undisputed number one in China's cloud industry as well. Therefore, it is not surprising that Alibaba's AI revenues are soaring at the moment. With having the strongest market positioning in cloud, Alibaba is well prepared to absorb a significant portion of the expected rapid growth of the AI market in China.
Alibaba's CEO Eddie Wu recently announced an aggressive increase in spending on AI, one that goes beyond its original $50 billion-plus target. Also at the conference, the company unveiled its largest-ever language model, the Qwen3-Max, a new AI model with over a trillion parameters. The launch of the new model highlights Alibaba’s advanced R&D talent and puts it firmly in the lead with large-scale language models. The model also brings the company closer to reaching its goal of becoming the world’s biggest full-stack AI service provider, offering not just software but also all the infrastructure, data centers, and developer tools required to run an entire AI suite of services. As such, the company is significantly expanding its worldwide infrastructure with new data centers in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. This will also help the company serve its international clients and support efforts to reduce its dependence on its domestic market. It is clear evidence that the company is shifting from a China-centric business model to one capable of starring in a main role on the world stage.
Besides investments in R&D and capex, there are also technological partnerships. Alibaba’s alliance with Nvidia is yet more proof that this is a company with clear intentions to become a leading player in both consumer AI and advanced enterprise-grade applications. It’s an alliance that brings physical AI and robotics development tools to Alibaba Cloud. These are areas that could become key growth drivers in the next decade, enabling Alibaba Cloud to offer its clients and developers a much wider and more powerful set of AI tools. Working with Nvidia puts Alibaba head-to-head with some major U.S. and European cloud providers too. Just as the NBA deal shows consumer-facing strength, so this deal underlines the company’s enterprise credibility. In short, this is a company with big AI ambitions: global, technical, and future-proof ambitions that also align with the CEO’s recent increased spending announcement.

Alibaba's latest earnings
I am not going to write a lot about Alibaba's e-commerce business because it is mature, and Alibaba boasts an unmatched audience across its platforms. Due to its massive scale, I do not expect this business to become the fastest-growing segment of Alibaba. Consumer spending depends very much on the country's broader economic environment, and everything is fine with the Chinese economy, which demonstrated a 4.8% growth over the first nine months of 2025. Moreover, Fidelity suggests that the Chinese economy is still in the recovery phase, which is usually followed by expansion. Therefore, I expect the company's largest business to demonstrate a healthy trajectory.

Fidelity
In addition, there are new endeavors beyond e-commerce and cloud. The recent success of Amap, Alibaba's mapping and navigation platform, is a solid complement to the company's business mix. During China’s Golden Week holiday, a peak travel period for the country, Amap enjoyed a record-breaking number of daily users, proving it’s the country’s go-to navigation tool, especially in a market where Google Maps remains inaccessible. What’s more is that Alibaba has woven AI into Amap with features like smart assistants, safety alerts, and intelligent business/restaurant rankings, which helps both users and merchants. These aren’t gimmicks either—these help make the app stickier. And because more people then use Amap, it feeds more data to Alibaba, and gives it more ways to monetize, such as via ads, merchant services, and local partnerships.

Seeking Alpha
Last but not least, Alibaba's valuation is attractive. The current P/E is already quite conservative at below 20. Due to the highly likely robust EPS growth over the next few years, Alibaba's P/E is expected to drop significantly.
Reasons To Avoid BABA
There is a so-called "Cold War" between the U.S. and China, which creates both trade and technological obstacles affecting the largest players of both countries. I think this might be the main reason behind Alibaba's extremely conservative forward P/E ratio trajectory. In addition, a couple of years ago there were rumors that Chinese companies might be delisted from America's stock exchanges. We do not see these rumors at the moment, but potential delisting does not look like a completely impossible scenario if this "Cold War" intensifies.
Another big reason why Alibaba might be valued relatively cheaply is that the Chinese economy is likely to face a notable demographic problem over the next few decades. According to the World Health Organization, China has one of the fastest-aging populations in the world. They expect there will be a staggering 400 million people over the age of 60 in China by 2040.
The Verdict
I think that despite geopolitical and demographic risks, Alibaba is a compelling investment opportunity. I think so because despite quite aggressive recent rhetoric from President Trump, the last few months demonstrated to us that administrations of both countries are able to achieve agreements. China's potential demographic crisis is a risk, but it is partially offset by the fact that Alibaba operates internationally. Therefore, I think that Alibaba is a Strong Buy.

ticker: UPWK
company_name: Upwork
stance: long
time_span: medium_term
reasoning_content:
Upwork's strong fundamentals, low valuation, and recent profitability make it an attractive buy, despite modest revenue growth.
AI and other risks exist, but I see them as manageable and not existential threats to Upwork in the near term.
The gig economy remains robust, with Upwork holding a dominant market position and benefiting from global freelance trends.
Discounted cash flow analysis suggests Upwork is undervalued, with significant upside potential even under conservative growth assumptions.
ilze79/iStock via Getty Images
While I haven’t really been on the platform much these past few years, Upwork (and Elance before it) was once a primary source of income. As with many of these platforms, there were goods and bads, but on the whole, I appreciated the opportunities afforded. Looking at Upwork now, I think the company offers a solid investment opportunity and favorable valuation.
Still, there are some key threats that could undermine Upwork (UPWK), including artificial intelligence potentially limiting the gig economy. Meanwhile, a tight labor market may reduce the number and/or quality of freelancers. Further, with many businesses adopting a wait-and-see approach owing to tariffs and economic uncertainty, budgets for freelancers may be under pressure. Still, these concerns are speculative and likely not near-term threats. Given the overall strength of the gig economy, I believe Upwork has bright days ahead.
A Gig Here, A Gig There, A Gig Everywhere
Upwork ranks among the largest freelancing platforms in the world, alongside Freelancer and Fiverr (FVRR). Clients can find freelancers offering a plethora of different services, including data analysis, programming, content creation, and more. Freelancers, too, can find many opportunities, and parties the world over can get in touch and collaborate with one another. In the United States, an estimated 64 million people freelanced in 2023, and by 2028, freelancers in the USA alone (some part-time, others full-time). In other words, the gig economy is massive, and outside of transportation, Upwork holds a dominant market position.​​

Looking at the infographic above, you’ll note that freelancers are projected to top 90 million by 2028. Why so much growth? Many businesses seem to prefer freelancers since they don’t have to pay for benefits like healthcare, and letting them go is often easier than laying off employees. Further, many freelancers may also prefer freelancing, as they can often work from home and on their own schedule (within reason, of course).
The data discussed so far has largely been in regard to the United States. However, Upwork supports both freelancers and businesses the world over. Upwork has enabled companies big and small to outsource tasks, thus freeing up employees to work on more challenging tasks. Upwork also helps companies fill in gaps. A local mom-and-pop coffee shop probably doesn’t have the need for a full-time marketing expert. However, hiring such an expert for a few hours here and a few hours there could pay off in a big way.
Yet with AI growing more popular, one does have to wonder if many workers will end up obsolete.
AI is an Opportunity and a Threat
I primarily used Upwork to land various writing jobs. Finance, healthcare, pets, I wrote content on pretty much everything. Upwork reports that full-time freelancers on their website pull in about $41 per hour. At least when I was working on the website, it was relatively easy to command more than $65 per hour. And for a long time, gigs were plentiful. I could log in, find at least 10 interesting gigs, then apply to them, and I typically could expect to land 2-4 of the projects.
Now-a-days? AI has been gobbling up many of the smaller projects and content writing jobs. While I’m not working on Upwork right now, I have taken a gander at the job postings from time to time. Not only are there far fewer writing jobs than in the past, but pay has been declining, and the number of applicants competing for various jobs can quickly reach into the dozens.
Copywriting isn’t dead. Companies still need copy. Some companies still need or want old-fashioned human copy. Yet human copywriting has started to trend more toward niche demand than a business staple. In many situations and for many (but not all) topics, AI can generate decent enough webpage copy, blogs, summary bullet points (say for a brochure), so on and so forth.
Circling back to Upwork, this means that the platform could see fewer and fewer writing jobs posted. Upwork gets a cut of projects, so fewer writing jobs will result in lower revenue. Writers may leave the platform or downgrade to unpaid subscription plans as well, further costing Upwork money. The loss of writing jobs in and of itself will probably produce limited damage to Upwork. Yet we’re also seeing AI stepping in to write code, optimize ad campaigns, handle customer service chats, and so on.
Still, it’s not all bad news. Website designers, programmers, content strategists, and many other professionals can leverage AI to improve efficiency and to provide better services. Businesses in need of such services can turn to Upwork’s large pool of freelancers. You can even find AI talent on the platform. At least for now, I don't believe AI is an existential threat to Upwork, although it probably is a serious threat for people in specific roles.
Why I Could Be Wrong
First, we’re starting to see some pushback against the gig economy, and it’s not just customers and gig workers either. Governments have, in some cases, become leery of freelancers and gig workers. Regulatory crackdowns and reclassifying freelancers as employees have affected the rideshare industry and other parts of the gig economy. I don’t think Upwork is as exposed, but there may still be regulatory risks.
I may also be underestimating AI. At the moment, I see it as a productivity booster in more fields. However, as the technology advances, more and more people may become “obsolete.” This could reduce demand for freelance labor.
UPWK Fundamentals and Valuation
First, Upwork’s P/E GAAP [TTM] weighs in at just 8.25, well below Fiverr’s 53.72. Given how high PE ratios have gotten in the United States, such a low PE ratio jumps off the page. Of course, sometimes low PE ratios hint at serious trouble, but in Upwork’s case, I am not finding anything that scares me off. Upwork has $622 million in cash and short-term investments versus $645.7 in total liabilities, while net income measures ~$235 million. For quite some time, Upwork struggled to become profitable, but over the last few years, profits have swollen.

Revenue growth is perhaps a tad bit slow at 7.21%. The net income margin [TTM] is an excellent 30.46%, while the gross profit margin comes in at 77.78%. Fiverr, meanwhile, has a net income margin of just 4.51%, but revenues are growing at 10.41%.

GuruFocus
Turning to GuruFocus’s DCF calculator, I find UPWK may be dramatically undervalued. In order to justify current prices, Upwork will have to secure FCF growth of just 1.36%. Setting FCF growth at 20%, which is in line with UPWK’s levered FCF growth, I find UPWK’s fair value to be north of $38. Even if we cut FCF to 10%, UPWK is still worth more than $21, as illustrated above.
(I set the discount rate at 10%, as I use that as my standard rate for most companies to make them easier to compare. The terminal growth rate was set at 4% to align with typically observed GDP growth rates.)

My fellow Seeking Alpha analysts aren’t as bullish as me, and overall, UPWK is classified as a hold. Seeking Alpha’s quant tools, on the other hand, agree that Upwork is a buy. I’ll admit, I’d have liked to see stronger revenue growth, but beyond that, Upwork seems to be in good shape in terms of fundamentals and valuation.

Upwork will be releasing earnings on August 6. Currently, the consensus EPS estimate is for 26 cents, unchanged from a year prior. However, Upwork last reported earnings of 34 cents, well above the projected 25 cents. I suspect Upwork will beat estimates again this quarter and wouldn't be surprised if EPS was above 30 cents.
Key Takeaway: Upwork Looks Like a Good Gig to Me
Upwork’s favorable fundamentals and turn towards profitability earn a buy rating from me. There are serious risks, like AI and regulatory changes, to keep an eye on, but that’s pretty common these days in many different industries. I also expect demand for freelance labor to remain high for now, and cost-cutting could become more important. This may ultimately benefit Upwork and gig workers.

Summary
Cisco's AI infrastructure business is robust; total revenue grew across all geographic regions, with notable outperformance versus expectations.
Despite solid Q3 results, slowing RPO growth and weak Q4 revenue guidance signal potential demand softness and a break in recent growth trends.
Valuation is stretched, with Cisco's P/S ratio near multiyear highs and a significant premium to IT sector peers despite slowing revenue growth.
Given overvaluation and demand concerns, I am downgrading Cisco to a sell rating and encouraging investors to consider taking profits.
Sundry Photography
Back in April, I upgraded Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) from a sell rating to a hold rating citing a resilient outlook. It seems I was too conservative as the stock has gained around 25% since then. Cisco was the critical infrastructure provider during the Internet Bubble and the company remains relevant today as the company pushes into AI infrastructure solutions. In the below analysis it is shown that while AI demand is strong for their Q3, slowing growth in RPO and weak Q4 revenue guidance suggests a mixed outlook. The stock is therefore overvalued and I believe a downgrade back to a sell is appropriate now.
Seeking Alpha
Strong AI Demand
Let's start today's discussion with a look at their all-important AI business. They divide this business into three units. The first is AI Training Infrastructure. In their FY2025 Q3, they had more than $600 million of orders, representing a third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth with webscalers. I believe this clearly shows that demand for their infrastructure is robust currently. The next unit is AI Inference. They reported a "fifth consecutive quarter of Data Center Switching order growth in Q3 FY25," showing that there was resilient demand in this unit. Lastly, for their AI connectivity unit, orders for their networking products were up double-digits again for the third consecutive quarter. In my view, these results show that Cisco is set to capture a notable part of the AI infrastructure market. Furthermore, as a part of the U.S.'s Middle East push, the company announced deals for Sovereign AI. Next, we'll turn to their financial results to see if this strong demand is translating into profits.
Revenue Growth Accelerates
Data by YCharts
Cisco reported their most recent earnings on May 14th. They generated revenues of $14.1 billion, up 11% YoY. While revenues are still some distance below the peak seen in FY2023 Q4, they have recovered significantly. In addition, Q3 represented the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth improvement and so overall, the business is in a significantly better position than it was just a few quarters ago. This revenue figure also beat expectations by $91.47 million to show outperformance.

Cisco Q3 Presentation
As you can see above, revenues were up across all three of their geographic regions. Revenues in the Americas increased by 13.67% while EMEA and APJC increased by 8.04% and 8.60% respectively. The fact that their largest geographic market grew the most is a promising sign for the company. For gross margin, there were some mixed results. Gross margin dipped 20 basis points in both the Americas and APJC but was up 1.6 percentage points in the EMEA. Despite some inconsistency, company-wide gross margin still increased by 30 basis points, showing that their pricing power remains robust overall.
RPO Growth Slows

Cisco Q3 Presentation
Cisco's total remaining performance obligations increased by 7% YoY to $41.7 billion, with Services RPO increasing by 5% and Product RPO increasing by 10%. While these figures are still healthy, do note that total RPOs were up 16% in their Q2 with Services RPO and Product RPOs up 8% and 25% respectively. Therefore, there is a considerable deceleration in RPO increases versus the previous quarter. While this isn't a major cause for concern at this point, I believe investors should practice some cautiousness as this could potentially indicate some weakness in demand.
Other Noteworthy Items
For their Q3, Cisco reported an adjusted EPS of $0.96, up 9% YoY. This is a minor acceleration of growth from the previous quarter's 8%. This figure also beat expectations by $0.04 to show outperformance. As discussed earlier, gross margin expanded YoY. Operating margin also increased as it expanded from 34.2% to 34.5% to show strong business efficiency. For operating cash flow, Cisco reported a 2.17% increase, which is respectable but a bit sluggish when compared to the revenue and EPS growth rates. Therefore, the business' cash generation seems a little weak in my view. Nonetheless, Cisco increased capital returns to shareholders YoY. Dividend payout was basically flat YoY at $1.6 billion but share repurchases increased from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Furthermore, they still have $15.4 billion authorized for share buybacks and so Cisco seems to be on the path of returning more capital to shareholders at this point.
Guidance Is Decent

Cisco Q3 Presentation
For their Q4, Cisco is expecting to see midpoint revenues of $14.6 billion. This implies growth of 7.35% YoY, a slowdown from Q3's 11.39%. Recall that there have been four consecutive quarters of revenue growth improvement and so it seems likely that this trend will come to an end. For gross margin, they are expecting 68% at the midpoint. This is a minor improvement from the prior year period's 67.9%, showing that pricing power is expected to remain robust. As for operating margin, they are expecting a midpoint of 34%, a notable improvement from 32.5% YoY. This shows business efficiency is continuing to trend in the right direction. Lastly, Cisco's midpoint expectation for adjusted EPS is $0.97, representing a growth of 11.49% YoY. This is an acceleration from Q3's 9%. Overall, I would say their Q4 guidance was decent as the improvements in profitability offset the slowdown in revenue growth.
Stock Is Overvalued
Data by YCharts
The P/S ratio for Cisco hit a three-year high just very recently. It is currently just a hair off those highs and is at a reading of 4.973. I believe this shows potential overvaluation. In the revenue analysis, it was shown that revenue growth has accelerated to one of the highest levels in the past few years. Furthermore, it was shown that company-wide gross margin expanded. These results can support a high valuation but the revenue outlook was a bit weak. As discussed above, revenue growth is expected to slow from 11.39% to 7.35% after four consecutive quarters of growth improvement. This is a significant break from that trend and could be a sign of lower demand. Another potential sign of lower demand is the slowdown in the increases of RPOs. Recall that Q3 increases were 7% versus Q2's 16% so there should be some concern that demand may not be overly strong moving forward. Therefore, I believe the P/S ratio at multiyear highs suggests a bit of overoptimism on the company's prospects as it may not be all smooth sailing from here. Also, note that Cisco's P/S is at around 50% premium to the IT sector's median P/S as of this writing. With growth expected to fall into the single digits, I believe this shows overvaluation versus peers.
Bulls Are In Control

Yahoo Finance
The 50-day SMA has been above the 200-day SMA for the past six months to show general long-term bullishness. The gap between the SMAs has expanded since mid-June and so there has been a resurgence in upward momentum. As for the near term, the stock has been above the Bollinger Bands midline since late April and so clearly the bulls have held onto control for an extended period. The MACD histogram has been relatively flat since the end of May, however, so there are some near-term momentum concerns. Nonetheless, the RSI has remained above 50 since late April and so while momentum is a bit lacking, the bulls have been in clear control of the stock. Overall, I believe there is not too much to complain about regarding Cisco's technical setup currently.
Final Thoughts
From Cisco's Q3 results, the company seems to be on quite solid footing. AI demand is strong and revenue growth accelerated once again. However, when digging deeper, the slowing pace of RPO increases signals some potential weakness ahead. This is echoed in their Q4 guidance as revenue growth is expected to slow. While strong margin and EPS guidance help to offset that, in the long term, it may be concerning that the pace of revenue growth is slowing. As a result, the stock seems to be overvalued with the P/S just a hair below multiyear highs. I believe this justifies a downgrade to a sell rating as investors should take advantage of the strong technicals to take profits.

source_title: The Retail Investor Effect: Why Palantir's Price May Be Too Hot To Handle
ticker: PLTR
company_name: Palantir Technologies Inc.
stance: short
time_span: long_term
reasoning_content:
Summary
Palantir's strong revenue growth and expanding margins are impressive, but its current valuation is unsustainable, driven by hype around AI and government contracts.
The stock trades at extreme multiples—P/S above 100 and PE over 300—making the risk-return profile unattractive for new investors at current levels.
Retail investor enthusiasm and meme stock status have pushed the price well above analyst targets, signaling overconfidence and potential for a sharp correction.
Despite robust fundamentals, low profitability and overvaluation lead me to rate Palantir as a sell; I recommend waiting for a price correction before considering a long position.
hapabapa
Introduction And Investment Thesis
Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) operates in the software development industry and specifically offers counterterrorism investigation solutions. The company mainly operates in the U.S., as well as in the United Kingdom and internationally. Its software platforms enable users to identify hidden patterns within massive datasets, creating a central operating system for clients’ data and transforming the ways their organizations operate.
Also, through its AI platform, PLTR offers services that transform structured and unstructured data into LLM-understandable objects, which organizations can process into tools for humans and LLM-driven agents.
The company demonstrates an impressive yoy price performance of 402.08%, starting from July 8, 2025, although investors remain cautious about its future potential.

Seeking Alpha
PLTR has a market cap of $328 billion and is currently trading at approximately $143 per share. I believe smart investors wouldn’t be wise to ‘hunt’ the stock at this price. Instead, I recommend waiting for a price correction and then taking a long position in the company.
Let me explain the reasons!
Market Prospects And The Company's Performance
PLTR operates under the software infrastructure industry, which is expected to show a CAGR of 6.5% from 2024 to 2025. Yes, the company’s market prospects are not so impressive; however, PLTR offers its solutions via two main segments: Government and Commercial. What does that mean?
This means that PLTR has long-term agreements, mainly with the U.S. army, to offer its services. The Government segment accounts for approximately 55% of the company’s total revenue, while the Commercial segment accounts for the remaining, as of FY24. Both segments have shown impressive revenue from FY19 to FY24, representing a CAGR of about 25% over this period.

Company’s Annual Reports
Furthermore, each segment appears to show a strong upward trend in terms of profit contribution. For example, the Government had a contribution margin of 23% in FY19, which increased to 60.4% in FY24, as shown in the table below.
I believe that these contribution margins will continue to grow as revenue increases, because the company offers software-based service with low incremental costs. As the business grows, it doesn’t need to spend much more to serve new customers. Therefore, as the business scales, I expect its contribution margins to expand.

Company’s Annual Report
Enhancement to the above is that the company consistently reports growing operating income. This means that PLTR continues to improve its business model along with its revenue growth. But, as we’ll see below, its profit levels still remain a weak spot in the company’s fundamentals.

Q1 2025 Business Update
Last but very important, the performance metric for the company is the one below. Remaining Performance Obligations [RPO] represents non-cancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized -or just backlog- and indicates a strong upward trend.

Q1 2025 Business Update
The second key performance metric, in my opinion, is Net Dollar Retention [NDR], which measures how much revenue has grown or declined from its existing customer base over the trailing twelve months, excluding any contribution from new customers.
Valuation And Investment Thesis
I believe that PLTR is one of the healthiest companies in the U.S. However, I also believe that it is significantly overvalued. More specifically, I think the risk-return relationship is not favorable for investors at this price level.
Keithen Drury, an analyst from The Motley Fool, explains the reasons why he believes that PLTR will remain relatively flat over the next five years. As we’ll see in more detail later in this article, Drury points out that PLTR’s overvaluation is best reflected in its high P/S ratio.
According to Drury, most companies that achieve a valuation of 100x sales or greater are typically doubling or tripling their revenue year over year, and Palantir isn't even close to that.
Of course, the company has demonstrated strong growth, but investors are already overly optimistic about PLTR’s future expectations. Based on the company’s guidance for FY25, it estimates revenue around $3.9B, which implies yoy growth of approximately 36%, compared to $2.86B in FY24. For sure, it is more than a solid revenue growth figure, but I believe it is already priced into the company’s current valuation.

Q1 2025 Business Update
Additionally, all the traditional valuation metrics indicate that Palantir is extremely overvalued. Why do investors ‘hunt’ a company with a P/E above 300? A strong indicator of the company’s overvaluation is its PEG ratios.
The TTM PEG ratio is 6.55, but the FWD PEG (non-GAAP) is even higher, at 7.74. This signals that - given the estimated revenue growth of approximately 36%, as above mentioned - the company’s current price appears highly overvalued. In my opinion, investors have pushed the company's stock price, primarily due to AI hype and its contracts with the U.S. army, rather than its actual revenue growth.
As previously mentioned, the company’s P/S is above 100, which means that investors are paying 100 times the current revenue per share. I believe this is not a sustainable ratio for long-term investments.
Seeking Alpha
Lastly, I want to refer to two key indicators that, in my opinion, reflect investors’ overconfidence expectations and hype regarding Palantir’s future price performance, without taking into consideration the company’s financials.
As the first graph illustrates, PLTR’s current price is above the average analyst target price of $102.19 and is instead closer to the highest target of $155. In combination with the second graph, which shows that this is the second time the actual price significantly exceeds the average target price, it provides a clearer evidence of investor overconfidence.
With a closer look, investors may notice that the last time the actual price was so above the target, the stock eventually declined to meet the target level. I believe the same pattern may repeat.

Seeking Alpha
Last but not so obvious is that PLTR’s has an army of retail investors, as highlighted in a Business Insiders’ article. Let me explain again!
Based on Vanda Research - a firm that tracks retail investor activity and sentiment, retail traders poured a net $170.3 million into the stock over the last five days, the firm reported on Thursday, June 26, 2025.
Furthermore, the firm said Palantir as a recurring meme stock and continued with: "Retail traders are bullish on government contracts and AI potential, with high conviction among holders."
From the above, the good news is that the company enjoys brand loyalty even at the investor level and certainly has a strong narrative. On the other hand, the bad news is that many of these retailers are more emotionally driven investors and show extreme hype around PLTR’s growth expectations- driven by AI and military contracts- but they invest beyond the company’s fundamentals.
Therefore, in my opinion, this is a strong evidence for the company’s overvaluation.
Risk Analysis
The main risk factors, in my view, consist of low profit margins despite strong revenue growth and non-reasonable hype around the company’s future revenue expectations.
As a fast-growing company, Palantir’s profitability still remains low relative to its revenue levels. The company has reported profits only in the past two years, as the table below illustrates. Therefore, the company remains sensitive to changes or cancelation of any of its contracts.
Notably, Palantir managed to increase its profit margin from approximately 10% to 16% within just one year; however, this level remains relatively low, considering company’s revenue growth.

Company's Annual Report
As mentioned above, I believe its stock price is driven more by hype around AI and military contracts, rather than by revenue growth or fundamentals. Any disappointing result, falling short of analysts’ expectations, would negatively affect the company’s price performance and shake the trust of retail investors. Driving potentially, to a sharp price decline and increased volatility.

reasoning_content:
Summary
Foxconn Technology's revenue is surging on AI servers, reshoring, and EV deals, but profitability remains constrained by razor-thin margins and heavy customer vertical integration.
Despite strong top-line growth and attractive valuation ratios, Foxconn's underlying cash flow and margin trends reveal structural weaknesses and limited earnings quality.
Strategic moves into automation, robotics, and regional diversification offer hope but require significant capital and face execution and geopolitical risks.
Robert Way
Thesis
My research argues that Foxconn Technology Co., Ltd. (OTCPK:FXCOF) and (2354:Taiwan), long celebrated for unmatched scale and execution at wafer-thin margins, are now stuck on the ropes. Yes, revenue is ripping higher on AI servers, reshoring projects, and new EV deals. But the same big customers fueling that boom are yanking more of the tech stack in-house, turning Foxconn’s hard-won gains into a real showdown about whether they can turn all that volume into lasting profit before the supply-chain power balance flips for good.
Foxconn Technology’s Rapid Growth in a Vertically Integrating World
When I last wrote about Foxconn in March, the numbers on the surface looked great: February revenue of NT$551.4 billion had leaped 56.4% year-over-year, and the share price was being bid up on those collective visions of an AI-powered future. But the deeper currents felt sluggish to me. A price-to-earnings multiple north of 20×, when a fair reading of the cash-flow profile pointed closer to 15×, left me uneasy. Gross margin sat at a meager 9.1%, which was fully 82% below the industry median, and levered free cash flow had fallen more than half. Translation: those healthy headline numbers were juiced on hope, not the dull, repeat-it-till-you-die cash that keeps a factory breathing when the boom goes bust.
But now fast-forward four months, and Foxconn has again rewritten its record book. Second-quarter revenue reached NT$1.797 trillion, which translates to an increase of 15.8% from a year earlier and 9.5% sequentially, pushing first-half sales to NT$3.44 trillion and eclipsing the previous six-month high set back in 2022. We can see that the top-line acceleration is unmistakable, driven chiefly by Cloud and Networking Products, and that's where demand for AI servers has run very hot, just enough to offset softness in legacy smartphone assembly.
It's definitely no surprise to mention that the ongoing AI story is, of course, the immediate catalyst. As a quick side note, because the unreal, synthetic, unnatural, however you want to call it, AI-fueled tech continues to just get better and better, I, personally, tend to shrug at most forecasts beyond 2-3 years. With that said, looking at the short term, industry analysts expect global AI server shipments to expand roughly 24% this year, which they calculated by looking at North American hyperscalers that are still writing the bulk of the purchase orders.
Meanwhile, stateside, Foxconn’s decision to co-manufacture NVIDIA Corporation's (NVDA) GB300 systems in Houston therefore definitely looks like a well-timed move. Because these AI server racks command far juicier margins than Foxconn’s bread-and-butter PC and phone work, even a small shift in the mix could give profits a helpful bump. But overall gross margin is still parked in the single digits. And, as it goes with the data we get from Foxconn, or don't get in this case, without updated clarity on parts costs or depreciation, it’s hard for me to see whether the revenue burst is landing in earnings or just passing straight through to suppliers.
Next, complicating matters is the rising wave of vertical integration inside the AI stack. In everyday terms, more and more big-tech firms are building and controlling every major piece of their AI systems themselves. I can’t help wondering what’s happening behind closed doors that might turn out to be the next big disrupter, much the way pre-Internet garage bands evolved into entirely new music genres. I won’t drift too far off-topic, but a quick scroll through X shows homemade films that, in my view, are only 1-2 years away from challenging Hollywood’s dominance.
Back to Foxconn: when giants handle everything from specialized chips to the software running on them, this “do-it-all-in-house” movement squeezes outside suppliers, because the big players suddenly need far fewer parts and services from others.
Take Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), for example, because it's leaning ever harder on its in-house Trainium accelerators so it can run its AI programs without paying outside suppliers as much; Alphabet is doing much the same with its latest homemade processors, called TPU v6e, and is spreading them throughout its data centers (if you want to learn more, I recently covered GOOG here); and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) still buys plenty of third-party chips, but it’s putting off any server upgrades that aren’t absolutely necessary to keep its hardware budget from ballooning.
Taken together, that trio alone accounts for a disproportionate share of global data center capex. Let's look ahead, because, should they continue down the path of proprietary hardware, Foxconn is at risk of being squeezed between customers that develop their own core technology and component makers that command the lion’s share of the remaining value. So far, the company’s real advantage has been its knack for turning out custom hardware fast and at a huge scale, not a deep well of patented tech. But as the market shifts toward tight, closed ecosystems, that speed-driven edge could lose punch, and pricing power could slip, right at the moment when volumes are cresting.
Foxconn’s counterpunch is to dig deeper into advanced manufacturing and automation. At its Houston site, deep in the heart of Texas, the company plans to roll out two humanoid robot platforms in early 2026. Scroll through almost any social media feed and you’ll spot hints of that robot-filled future: machines roaming city streets, serving military or space missions, and even popping up as personal companions. Foxconn’s initial models are more pragmatic; one will be legged, the other mounted on an autonomous mobile base, and both are being trained to handle dense cabling and delicate component placement. In plain ROI terms, if the launch goes smoothly, labor productivity could jump, easing wage pressures in the U.S. and shrinking the gap between Foxconn’s slim gross margin and the richer spreads enjoyed by higher-mix EMS peers. Just as crucial, fully automated lines make it easier to localize production in high-cost regions, a strategic must as supply chains splinter along geopolitical lines.
That fragmentation, paradoxically, is opening other doors.
Case in point: across the United States, the business of contract electronics manufacturing is on track for a major growth spurt, and two forces are pushing it forward. First, Washington has opened the financial floodgates through the CHIPS Act, offering a carrotstick of rich incentives to build more of the supply chain near home. Second, tech brands are increasingly ditching the long, slow boat ride from Asia because, with factories just across the border, they can take orders to turn out more customized batches and get finished gear into engineers’ hands faster. I think it's fair to say that that backdrop explains why Foxconn is piling resources into its Guadalajara-to-Monterrey corridor and breaking ground on a new AI-server campus in Mexico.
Foxconn’s EV push follows the same “build closer to home” game plan. A couple of days ago, Seeking Alpha reported that it's in early talks with Nissan about sharing an aging Oppama factory and has a loose agreement with Mitsubishi as well. The idea is simple: breathe new life into underused car plants in mature markets, place a Foxconn badge on the EVs that roll out, and let the local automaker save jobs and political goodwill in the process. If it works, Foxconn could leap from its usual thin-margin assembly role into a lighter, more profitable position higher up the EV food chain.
Meanwhile, over in India, the company's gambit looks like it's generating real, measurable escape velocity as we see that between March and May, it shipped $3.2 billion worth of iPhones from the IT/outsourcing hub of the world to the United States, thereby lifting the India-to-U.S. ratio to 97%. For the first five months of this year, those shipments totaled $4.4 billion. For context, that's already beating the whole of 2024.
Foxconn’s Headwinds, Growth Potential, and Valuation
In the meantime, Foxconn’s Q2, while statistically strong on paper, showed some notable pressure points. To be fair, June's revenue of NT$540.24 billion is, after all, a 10.09% increase from the same month a year ago. Yet, compared with May, revenue actually fell 12.26%, and that's the steepest monthly drop of the year, and it did so across the board: Computing Products slipped, Smart Consumer Electronics sagged, Components and Other Products stumbled, and even the usually buoyant Cloud and Networking segment merely trodden water.
To complicate things, management cited the usual suspects of global political instability and exchange rate fluctuations as obstacles that need constant monitoring through the rest of 2025. That's pretty vague, but digging deeper, we see that the numbers back up that worry. Take the Smart Consumer Electronics unit, historically a revenue locomotive, which introduced fresh entertainment devices during the quarter, but the Taiwanese dollar’s appreciation neutralized the gains, leaving the division flat on a year-over-year basis. Personally, I've been traveling in southern Europe these days, watching the dollar slowly erode daily, causing micro-increases for a single Sicilian cannoli. But on a much, much larger scale though, in a world tilting from West to East and back again, even a venerable product line can be kneecapped by a currency twitch.
Nowhere is that collision clearer than in the world of AI servers, once touted as the next Mother Lode for all original design manufacturers. TrendForce still predicts that global AI server shipments will grow 24.3% this year, but that figure already represents a downward revision tied directly to Washington’s export curbs on high-end silicon bound for China. It is not simply that fewer boxes will ship; it is that the entire ecosystem—chip designers, integrators, hyperscale cloud buyers—has to tiptoe around new red lines that have been, honestly, difficult to keep up with. Consequently, as I laid out earlier, Foxconn is racing to redraw its own map, shifting assembly lines out of the Chinese mainland and into India. It's a necessary strategic pivot, and while theoretically elegant, it's got its own set of migraines.
Labor too, refuses to cooperate. More than 300 Chinese engineers and technicians were recently recalled from Indian plants, a move analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo assure us won't dent output because Taiwanese teams have already built out most capacity. That reassurance might be valid, but the optics still feel a bit off to me: a company known for seamlessly moving specialized talent across borders now has to explain why it's pulling back technicians without drawing attention to potential geopolitical tensions. I suppose it just illustrates this fine line Foxconn has to walk, balancing production stability, national security concerns, and the complexities of managing a global workforce.

FAST Graphs
Moving on to valuation, at the time of my analysis, Foxconn’s U.S.-listed ticker (FXCOF) changed hands at $1.77, giving a market capitalization of $2.5 billion.

Seeking Alpha
Subtract net cash and the enterprise value shrinks to $910 million, a figure that tells me it's a bargain if you isolate traditional value ratios: an EV-to-Sales of 0.13 times trailing and 0.09 times forward against a sector median of 3.42 times and an EV-to-EBITDA of 4.2 times trailing versus the sector’s 18.3 times. But it's a kind of mirage, if you will, that fades when earnings quality enters the frame. A blended price-to-earnings multiple of 20.5 times (see FAST Graphs data above) looks reasonable only until you see that normalized fair value sits closer to 16.5 times, implying the equity trades roughly 23% above intrinsic worth.

While a projected annual return of 10.74% may sound decent, respectable even, the fair-value estimate of $1.43 per share tells a colder truth.

This leads me back to the share price that's not cheap, and that's not because the market is asleep here; it's because the company’s profitability engine sputters. Just look at the gross margin, which rests at 5.33% alongside the near-50% norm of the broader information-technology cohort. Operating margins of 2.16% for EBIT and 3.05% for EBITDA do little to reassure me.

Seeking Alpha
Granted, the headline growth we covered earlier definitely appears spectacular, with revenue up 61.3% and EBIT up 82.5% year-over-year, but, bigger picture-wise, these are spikes that amount to a rebound from earlier slumps instead of ongoing evidence of a kind of durable momentum. For example, over 5 and 10 years, both EBIT and EBITDA have actually shrunk at double-digit compound annual rates, leading me to understand that this recent surge is less a renaissance than a dead-cat bounce.
And lastly, cash flow provides scant refuge as levered free cash flow expanded 15.4% year-over-year, but with a margin that's stuck at 1.72%, trailing the sector median by more than 85%. Operating cash flow may have grown 13.8%, yet it remains 34% below the sector median and more than half beneath the company’s own five-year average.

Meanwhile, because of those tactics to survive in a vertically integrating world, capital expenditure ballooned 62.9% in the last twelve months, implying that when money comes, most of it is devoured simply to keep facilities, tooling, and regional hedges in place. The pattern is clear: Foxconn spends heavily to preserve relevance rather than leapfrog competitors.
Final Verdict: Hold
I can’t dismiss the stock’s valuation discount to peers or the genuine traction in AI servers, Mexico reshoring, and India iPhone output, which together give Foxconn a credible path to margin repair. That said, thin cash flow and the threat of customers’ vertical integration still cap the near-term upside, so I’m still happy to stay on the sidelines and wait for clearer proof of sustainable profitability before getting either bullish or definitively bearish.

Summary
Without the requisite experience, it's always tempting to buy stocks on a roaring rally instead of trimming positions. I suggest that you take the latter approach here.
Celestica may be a remarkable company with a remarkable secular growth opportunity, but valuation trumps all other financial positives. A great company at a bad valuation is a bad investment.
Consider looking into healthcare's Eli Lilly as the next value opportunity. AI stocks have already recalibrated to fair and overvaluation. Healthcare is slower to react and will expand in 2026.

Since my last Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) analysis, the stock has gained 65% in price. Now is the time to trim your position.
We're all probably happy that the market is back to all-time highs, but the greatest investors are going to follow Charlie Munger's wisdom: "Invert, always invert." What does this mean? It means what Buffett said: "Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy." It's so simple, but so hard for most people to do. That's why I believe the best investors are the ones with the greatest psychological strength (and knowledge of the game).
Celestica has had an awesome 65% return in just a couple of months since my last analysis, in which I issued a Strong Buy rating. Now, I'm telling my readers "Hold," and by that, I mean "trim."
High Volatility is the Price of Elite Returns
The greatest investors of all time either embrace volatility like a religion, opt for more stable returns with a cash-flow generating undercurrent (usually in the form of investing an insurance float), or have statistical trading algorithms which bypass long-term holding considerations. Celestica stock falls into the first of these categories in most portfolio types (that said, it can definitely be statistically traded in and out of based on its volatility).
With volatile stocks, if you're a long-term holder, it's always best to buy at low valuations. Unlike stalwarts which compound slowly and steadily over time, buying a high-volatility stock at its peak is almost certainly going to lead to a lower total annual return for your holding period. In essence, it's always bad to buy stocks at high valuations anyway, even if the momentum factor looks good.
Celestica's financial growth rates will not be increasing as the years go on. They will be robust, but they will start to moderate downward as the AI opportunity starts to mature. This is perfectly natural; it is the same for almost all AI companies. However, it means that when such stocks become excessively overvalued (like right now for Celestica), it's best to trim to free up some cash for those undervalued opportunities that are destined to see the light of day later.
Business Structure Defines the Risk Profile
The other aspect of the investment case that ought to be scrutinized is that the top 10 customers account for about 73% of revenue, with the single largest customer at about 28%. That means that the business is not particularly resilient. It could actually be considered a high-return fragile asset that's benefiting from structural tailwinds but vulnerable to quick industry shifts and evolving competitive dynamics.
The good news is that Celestica isn't trading in commodities, but is instead designing hardware platform solutions directly with hyperscalers. Once Celestica is embedded, switching is costly for hyperscalers, and these Big Tech companies typically single-source design-heavy programs to reduce risk and maintain consistency. But they're also ruthless, and when the game changes, so does their partner base. For now, Celestica is somewhat secure as it offers the first-mover advantage in 800G/1.6T switches and full AI rack solutions, but don't take your eye off the ball and hold the stock at less than 5% of your portfolio if you're looking to risk-mitigate professionally through robust diversification. Whatever diversification detractors say, high alpha is best achieved with some diversification (10-15 stocks) and some form of antifragile strategy (like a dynamic cash position). Otherwise, you can be wiped out of the game through a black swan event—and then what?
The company's total debt is only $1.08 billion and the enterprise value is $18.35 billion with an EBITDA of $770.5 million and a cash position of $307.80 million. That makes the investment very secure from the standpoint of liquidity and validates management's decision to repurchase common stock of $452.8 million in the last 12 months. In other words, this is a shareholder-friendly business.
Here's Why You Don't Buy CLS Stock Now
I know it's tempting to buy a stock that's experiencing such a heavy rally, and such an investment can even be supported by momentum analysis. But based on valuation and fundamentals, this is not an elite moment to invest in the company. It's not even a good moment to invest in the company. Great company, bad time to buy—a common conundrum.
Let's hone in on the essential technicals. The stock is now way above the 50-week moving average in price and the 14-week Relative Strength Index ("RSI") is above 70. That means it's time to trim, or at least definitely do not buy more. We'll get a pullback again soon, and when that 14-week RSI gets back down to about 50, you can strike.

Celestica One-Week-Period Chart (Oliver Rodzianko's Chart, Using Seeking Alpha)
To be clear, with a stock exhibiting such strong momentum as this, it doesn't need to be below the 50-week moving average in price to be a good investment. We're not investing in pure value here, it's really a growth and momentum stock, and it shares similarities to NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). As you can see below, with elite growth investments, sometimes buying above the 50-week moving average is part of the course. But I wouldn't be buying either stock (or any stock) when the 14-week RSI is above 70; 60 is probably the upper limit for me, and then I'd need evidence of expanding, not contracting, future annual revenue and earnings growth rates.

In terms of a price target for Celestica, based purely on my analysis of the technical charts, I'm expecting about $170 in an optimistic base case in 12 months. I expect a periodic pullback and then momentum-based gains leading it to new (overvalued) highs. I'll probably be selling a lot of my AI positions at that point, and I've already started trimming. Frothy valuations are not a symbol of a buyers' market even though that's when most people have recently been buying. Remember "invert, always invert."
Conclusion: Hold
This is a typical moment in the AI market where you should be holding your horses. Have some restraint; it pays off in the long run. Discerning fair value is not a mathematical science for most operators; it's a perceptive art. We all have our own means of ascertaining what's objective, and I've settled on the weekly-period charts and simple indicators like the 50-week and 200-week moving averages and 14-week RSI as parameters for reliable and efficient assessment. Celestica is a strong company, with a remarkable and fortunate market position, but the valuation is now too high for strong investment. Slow down, take a breather, trim some AI positions, and look for undervalued stocks—like healthcare's Eli Lilly and Company (LLY)—to ease the valuation constraints currently impeding forward returns to the AI market.
