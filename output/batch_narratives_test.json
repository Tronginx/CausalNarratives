      "source_text": "TSMC: A Strong Buy At All-Time Highs\nSummary\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited delivered strong Q3 results, beating expectations with robust revenue growth and expanding gross margins.\nTSMC dominates the foundry market with over 70% share, benefiting from surging AI chip demand. The company is seeing strong revenue and earnings momentum. Gross margins are rising.\nThe foundry raised its 2025 revenue and CapEx guidance amid a booming AI chip market.\nTSMC trades at a significant discount to peers like NVDA and AMD, offering an attractive value-to-risk profile and 23% upside potential.\nDespite cyclicality risks, TSMC's market leadership and profitability support a continued strong buy rating, even near all-time highs.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited aka TSMC (NYSE:TSM) submitted a strong earnings sheet for the third fiscal quarter on Thursday, highlighting strong profitability amid consistent spending momentum in the Data Center industry as well as an ability to expand its gross margins. The foundry beat expectations on the bottom and the top lines and the financial figures painted a very rosy picture for this chip play.\n\nTSMC continues to dominate the foundry market and reported double-digit earnings growth in the September quarter. Despite sizzling business performance, shares of the foundry are still very attractively valued and much cheaper compared to Nvidia (NVDA), as an example. I see a favorable risk profile amid a massive market share in the foundry industry and a raised guidance for FY 2025 revenue, and I continue to recommend TSMC as a Strong Buy, despite shares of the foundry trading at all-time highs.\n\nPrevious rating\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing were a Strong Buy for me previously -- The Only AI Fab Game In Town -- because of the firm's dominant position in the foundry market. In the third-quarter, TSMC benefited from a strong order situation for AI chips and the company was able to translate demand for its products into serious growth for revenue and earnings. I like that TSMC continues to expand its gross margins, highlighting pricing strength, and I see continual upside revaluation momentum if current CapEx trends last.\n\nTSMC beat Q3 ’25 estimates\nThe world’s biggest foundry reported better-than-expected results for its September quarter amid a major AI chip spending splurge: TSMC had GAAP earnings of $2.92 per-share, beating the consensus estimate by $0.32 per-share. The top line came in at $33.1B and was $1.5B better than the average prediction.\n\nTSMC is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world occupying a crucial part in the semiconductor value chain: TSMC manufacturers, on behalf of the world’s largest chip-design companies, high-performing AI chips in its foundries. These chips are used in everything from electric vehicles to robots and Data Centers, and are the hottest commodity in the hyperscaler market right now.\n\nIn the third fiscal quarter, TSMC generated $33.1B in net revenue, showing a massive 41% year-over-year growth rate… and beating the firm’s own guidance of $31.8-33.0B in revenue. TSMC’s revenue growth has soared in recent quarters, especially in the last two years, as a booming market for AI chips caused serious tailwinds for the company’s core chip manufacturing business.\n\nImportantly, TSMC managed to translate this sizzling demand for AI chips into real margin and earnings growth. In Q3 ’25, TSMC had a gross margin of 59.5%, showing a 0.9 PP margin gain compared to the previous quarter and exceeding the top-end of its third-quarter guidance by 2 PP. In terms of earnings, TSMC’s income grew a massive 39.0% year-over-year, highlighting that the company is able to grow very profitably.\n\n\nThe ability to grow both quickly and improve its profitability profile is directly related to TSMC controlling most of the foundry market.\n\nTSMC is the most significant foundry player in the industry that is manufacturing AI chips on behalf of companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Apple (AAPL). In the second quarter, the last quarter for which market share data is available, TSMC allegedly had a market share of ~71%, according to Counterpoint Research, leading Samsung and other foundries by a lot. TSMC earlier this year increased its investment program and is now targeting $165B in investments in the U.S. in order to build domestic chip manufacturing capacities.\n\n\nAs the world's largest foundry, TSMC is well positioned to benefit from increases in capital spending in the Data Center industry. Nvidia is projecting that CapEx spending in this market is set to grow to $3-4 trillion by the end of the decade which calculates to 40% average annual growth. This growth, which may be driven especially by AI investments in the industrial realm, could be a major boost for TSMC which is already heavily investing in ramping up its AI chip production.\n\nIn terms of free cash flow, TSMC remained highly profitable as well in Q3, although the company should be expected to sacrifice short term profitability in order to grow its manufacturing capabilities in the quarters ahead.\n\nIn the third quarter, TSMC generated free cash flow of NT$139.4B, showing a decline rate of 25% year-over-year, mainly due to higher CapEx (+39% Y/Y). As a result, the foundry's free cash flow margin contracted by more than 10 PP year-over-year to 14.1% as of the end of the September quarter.\n\nTSMC’s valuation\nIn addition to strong secular growth momentum across key performance metrics such as revenue, gross margin and earnings, TSMC has one of the most appealing risk profiles, in my opinion.\n\nThe semiconductor company is growing its business hand over fist and currently trades at a forward price-to-revenue ratio of 26.1X… making the chip enterprise significantly cheaper than Nvidia or AMD. Technically, Nvidia and AMD are chip-design companies and depend on TSMC for chip manufacturing, but all companies benefit fundamentally from the same underlying growth drivers in the Data Center industry: AI.\n\nShares of Nvidia and AMD are trading, on a forward FY 2026 basis, at earnings multipliers of 28.3X and 37.3X. AMD especially has become significantly more expensive lately after the company announced a landmark chip deal with OpenAI (OPENAI). Nvidia, the world's largest chip-design company, struck its own $100B investment deal with OpenAI in September that ensures that the Chat.GPT creator will get access to Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin GPU platform (expected for 2026).\n\nI fully expect shares of TSMC to achieve at least a ~30X forward earnings multiplier which at this point implies a fair value of $369. This calculation is based off of a consensus EPS estimate of $12.29/share next year which implies approximately 23% upside revaluation potential.\n\nRaised outlook for CapEx and revenue\nSoaring demand for leading-edge chips for AI applications has led TSMC to raised its guidance for key metrics for FY 2025 on Thursday as well: TSMC expects to spend between $40-42B on capital investments this year, showing a $2.0B raise at the low-end of guidance. The firm's revenue guidance for FY 2025 implies 35% year-over-year growth vs. 30% earlier this year.\n\nRisks with TSMC\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is growing rapidly, but risks exist that should not be discounted. TSMC runs an enormously capital-intensive business which limits competition. However, capital spending in the semiconductor industry is notoriously volatile and demand for chips can disappear overnight if companies fear a recession and adjust their CapEx levels in expectations of slowing demand. What would my change my mind about TSMC is if the semiconductor enterprise were to see a sector-wide decline in CapEx spending or started to see a gross margin contraction in its manufacturing business.\n\nFinal thoughts\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing submitted a strong earnings sheet for the third fiscal quarter on Thursday that was marked by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and material earnings momentum. TSMC is still by far the world’s largest foundry, with a market share of more than 70% (based off of Counterpoint Q2 '25 market data) which makes the company a potential winner, in my book, as hyperscalers and chip firms race to up-grade their IT infrastructures in the next several years. Shares are moderately valued given the strength of the value proposition and I continue to see a lot of upside revaluation potential for TSMC... even with shares trading at all-time highs.\n\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The collaboration, aimed at developing energy-efficient chip platforms to power Meta’s personalization and recommendation systems, has been received as a sign of long-term commitment to scaling AI capabilities across its ecosystem. The partnership with Arm comes at a crucial time for Meta, which has faced a volatile trading month amid market-wide profit-taking in large-cap tech. Investors view the deal as a strategic step that could strengthen the company’s infrastructure backbone, allowing more efficient AI model deployment across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. The agreement aligns with Meta’s broader AI roadmap, which focuses on delivering personalized experiences while improving computational efficiency. Arm’s expertise in low-power architectures offers potential cost and performance advantages over traditional chip designs. Analysts have interpreted this as a move that could reduce reliance on external chipmakers and accelerate Meta’s internal AI scaling efforts. Fundamentally, the development underscores Meta’s ambition to move beyond short-term advertising cycles and focus on building long-term technological depth. This pivot is increasingly significant as the competition in generative and recommendation-based AI intensifies, with peers like Google and Amazon also ramping up infrastructure spending. Technical setup shows early signs of recovery From a technical standpoint, Meta is showing signs of stabilization after its recent corrective phase. The stock rebounded from the $694–$675 support zone, which coincides with the 100-day exponential moving average and the lower Bollinger Band. Price has now reclaimed the 20-day EMA at $726, while a close above the 50-day EMA at $733 would further confirm a short-term trend reversal. Meta stock price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bollinger Bands have narrowed, signaling reduced volatility compared to September’s swings. A sustained move above the midline could pave the way toward resistance at $758, followed by $780, where prior distribution occurred. The Relative Strength Index has recovered to 52, suggesting that downside momentum has eased and buyers are gradually regaining control. On the downside, $720 remains immediate support, followed by deeper cushions at $694 and $675. Failure to hold these levels could expose the stock to renewed selling pressure, though the technical bias remains constructive while it trades above the lower channel boundary. Outlook As highlighted in prior analysis, Meta’s broader trend remains underpinned by investor confidence in its AI expansion and data center build-out. The Arm partnership reinforces this narrative, adding a new layer to its competitive advantage in custom computing. With earnings season approaching, markets will focus on whether these investments translate into revenue acceleration or cost efficiencies. If the stock sustains momentum above $733, analysts expect a retest of $758 in the near term, with $780 marking a key inflection point for a potential return to the broader uptrend. For now, Meta’s combination of strategic clarity, technical recovery, and renewed investor optimism positions it as one of the more resilient AI-linked names in the market.",

The current wave of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption began in early 2023, after the introduction of ChatGPT highlighted the vast potential applications involving generative AI. Nvidia (NVDA +2.60% ), with its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), quickly became the standard-bearer for the AI revolution. Its stock has gained 1,160% since then, which has investors eager to find the next Nvidia, and a strong contender could be hiding in plain sight. While Nvidia stock has gained a respectable 33% over the past year, Broadcom (AVGO +1.97% ) has been on a tear, as its stock has soared 96% (as of this writing). Several recent developments help illustrate why investors are increasingly bullish on Broadcom stock, and why the company could well be the next Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Same tailwinds, different driver GPUs have played a pivotal role in the advancement of AI, providing the computational horsepower required to power the large language models (LLMs) that underpin AI. One of the trade-offs, however, is that these power-hungry chips consume a great deal of energy. Thus far, most hyperscalers have been willing to pay the price to have the most advanced processors with the fastest speeds, not to mention the extreme flexibility offered by GPUs. Since most AI processing occurs in data centers, Broadcom was already a beneficiary of AI, as management notes that \"99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology.\" The company pioneered the Ethernet switching and networking products that have become critical components in most data centers. However, it's Broadcom's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that offer the greatest potential for future growth, thanks to their increasing adoption for AI workloads. The specialized chips are customizable to specific tasks, offering a more energy-efficient alternative. The demand for these chips is evident in Broadcom's most recent results. Where to invest $1,000 right now When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,033% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500. They just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now available when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks › *Returns as of October 27, 2025 In its fiscal third quarter (ended Aug. 3), Broadcom generated record revenue of $15.9 billion, an increase of 22% year over year, fueling adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.69, which jumped 36%. It was clear that AI was the biggest contributor to its rising fortunes, as AI-specific revenue of $5.2 billion surged 63%. Management noted that Broadcom continued to expand its relationships with its three biggest hyperscale customers, widely believed to be Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance. CEO Hock Tam said, \"We continue to gain share at our three original customers.\" He also expects growth related to AI to continue to accelerate, outpacing the 50% to 60% the company has forecast for this year. Collapse NASDAQ: AVGO Broadcom Today's Change (1.97%) $6.96 Current Price $361.09 AVGO ^SPX YTD 1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y Price VS S&P Key Data Points Market Cap $1672B Day's Range $355.07 - $362.73 52wk Range $138.10 - $374.23 Volume 563K Avg Vol 23M Gross Margin 63.13% Dividend Yield 0.01% Earlier this month, the company dropped a bombshell, saying it will help design and deploy 10 gigawatts of its customizable chips for ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The deal is likely incremental to Broadcom's already robust guidance, according to Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, who estimates that each gigawatt could translate to $20 billion in additional revenue. Furthermore, the deal serves to validate Broadcom's chips as a viable alternative to Nvidia's GPUs, which might attract additional large-scale users. Reitzes has previously argued that Broadcom should be a \"Magnificent Eight\" stock, an addition to the existing \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. He estimates that Broadcom will gain ground over time, eventually controlling 30% of the AI compute market. The next Nvidia? The expanding relationships with its existing customers, as well as the addition of OpenAI to its customer rolls, illustrate the path forward for Broadcom to become the next Nvidia. Furthermore, the AI market is expected to grow exponentially. Big Four accounting firm PwC estimates the market could be worth as much as $15.7 trillion annually by 2030, which helps underscore the magnitude of the opportunity. There is the matter of valuation to consider. Broadcom stock is currently selling for 38 times next year's earnings, compared to 29 for Nvidia. Both stocks currently fetch a premium, so they won't be a good fit for every investor. That said, both companies are at the crossroads of the AI revolution, which could continue to drive these industry pioneers higher in the months and years to come. Should you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $590,357!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,141,748!*",
